## Importance of Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering plays a vital role in this application as it directly influences the quality of the output generated by the **Google Gemini API**. The prompts are carefully designed to guide the model in providing the most relevant and actionable insights. Here’s how prompt engineering impacts different functionalities of the app:

- **Job Description Matching**: The prompt encourages the model to assess the alignment between the resume and job description, focusing on key skills, experiences, and keywords.
- **Resume Rewriting**: The model uses a prompt to rewrite specific sections of the resume, ensuring it is optimized for ATS, and aligns the technical skills and work experience with the job description.
- **ATS Scan**: By crafting a precise prompt, the model can evaluate how well the resume matches the job description and highlight missing keywords that may improve the resume’s chances of passing through ATS filters.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: The prompt helps guide the model in providing tailored suggestions that are specific to the job role, ensuring the advice is relevant and actionable.

In short, **prompt engineering** ensures that the model produces meaningful and useful responses by setting the correct context and expectations for each task, making it an essential part of the application’s effectiveness.
